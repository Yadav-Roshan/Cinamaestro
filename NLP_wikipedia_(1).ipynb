A struggling artist living in a cardboard box in Tompkins Square Park works his way up the rungs of the New York art world in the eighties, thanks in part to his association with Andy Warhol, the art dealer Bruno Bischofberger, poet and critic René Ricard, and fellow artist Albert Milo. Alongside the development of his artistic career, the film follows Basquiat\\'s tumultuous relationship with Gina, a fellow aspiring artist he meets while she is working as a waitress at the diner he frequents with his friend Benny. Their romance is affected by Basquiat\\'s affair with \"Big Pink\", a woman he picks up on the street,[4] and his habitual abuse of heroin. Eventually, Basquiat finds himself isolated by his fame, the death of Warhol, and his drug use. The film ends with an intertitle stating that Basquiat died of a heroin overdose on August 12, 1988, at the age of 27.  and Director is Julian Schnabel and Writer is Lech Majewski and Production is Eleventh Street Productions and Runtime is 106 minutes and Budget is $3.3 mill and Box office is $3 million and Rating is 6.9 and Genre is Biography, Drama.',\n",

It\\'s Jean\\'s. \\n\\nJean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urban \\npark around him is alive with a typically full range of the good \\nand bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box in which \\nhe has spent the night. There\\'s something about the way that he \\nstands while waking up that suggests he\\'s almost surprised at his \\nown body, the adultness of his limbs � just a subtle hint of him \\ncoming out of a dream.\\n\\nHe squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face. \\nHis hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of blue \\njeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered Wesleyan \\nUniversity T-shirt, and the inside lining of an overcoat. His \\nappearance is unruly, but it\\'s deliberate. He\\'s stylish. \\n\\nHe shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a \\nsmall book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. and a \\ncigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking \\ntape.\\n\\nJean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the \\nsky: \\n\\n\\nSUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY � STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFER\\n\\nJean sees the surfer, \\'riding the nose\\' in glistening, shimmering \\nsunlight.\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n\\nEXT.

He doesn\\'t like what he sees.\\n\\nJean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn\\'t erase itself. He draws \\na picture of Gina, using his fingers and the silverware, rendering \\nher last expression strikingly with a few quick lines. \\n\\nA GAUNT YOUNG MAN saunters up to Jean\\'s table. He\\'s sort of a  \\ntall Puerto Rican Alain Delon with sleepy eyes. He is BENNY.\\n\\nBENNY\\nHey � Willie Mays.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWillie Mays.\\n\\nSuddenly, Rene Ricard enters � a one-man parade.

MENTAL HOSPITAL (OUTSIDE THE CITY)\\n\\nWe see Jean crossing a lawn outside a mental hospital.\\n\\n\\nINT. MENTAL HOSPITAL � RECREATION / VISITING ROOM � DAY\\n\\nPSYCH. PATIENTS fill a cavernous day-room engaged in arts and \\ncrafts. Some of the sadder patients stare off into space as Jean \\ncrosses the room. He carries a plate of cookies and a full glass \\nof milk.\\n\\nHe approaches a sad, nice-looking, middle-aged black woman � the \\nsame one from the dream, earlier. She sits alone fondling a pillow \\nin her lap. It\\'s his mother, MATILDE. She doesn\\'t see him coming.\\n\\nAs he sets the plate in front of her, she notices him. She \\nrecognizes him and seems pleased, even in her isolation. He kisses \\nher on the cheek.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHey, mom.\\n\\nShe smiles slightly. \\n\\nJean takes a cookie. She does likewise.\\n\\nThey eat in silence, looking at each other, communicating what \\nthey can. \\n\\nTime passes. In between cookies her fingers find and break the \\nstems of the pillow feathers.\\n\\nBASQUIAT (CONT\\'D)\\nI met the girl I\\'m gonna marry.\\n\\nHis mother brightens. She drinks the milk. They finish the \\ncookies.\\n\\nMATILDE\\nDo you like it here?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI\\'d like it better in Hawaii.\\n\\n\\nINT. CARDBOARD BOX � NIGHT\\n\\nJean tries to sleep in the box. RAIN falls heavily onto it.\\n\\nDrops of water hit his face.\\n\\nHe wills it to stop. It doesn\\'t.\\n\\nFinally, he can\\'t stand it. Rain forces his blinking eyes open.\\n\\n\\nINT. BENNY\\'S APARTMENT �  NIGHT\\n\\nA door opens to reveal Jean\\'s wet face.\\n\\nBenny lets him in.\\n\\nJean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical \\ninstruments, beer cans, and homemade art. There\\'s a couch with a \\nsheet over it. \\n\\nJunk is piled in a corner � mostly art books and drawings. \\n\\nBenny sits down at an electric piano, which he\\'s evidently \\nplaying. He sings along, softly, working out the words, \\nconcentrating, absorbed.\\n\\nJean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and \\nstarts making up his own words.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n\"She loves me.\\nOh yeah she loves me!\\nShe loooooooves me,\\nOh yeah she loves me!\"\\nBring me some chicken, baby!\\n\\nBENNY\\nWould you shut the fuck up?

You\\'re always \\ngreat, Benny. \\n(goes back into \\'act\\')\\n\"Her name is G-I-N-A Gina\\nAnd she lo-oooves me.\"\\nI did say chicken!\\n\\nBenny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at Jean\\'s \\nself-centeredness.\\n\\nJean digs through a pile of garbage. Finally, he finds what he\\'s \\nlooking for � a pile of \"SAMO baseball cards\" � color Xeroxes of \\nhis favorite images and words. He pockets them.\\n\\nBASQUIAT (CONT\\'D)\\nI knew I left these somewhere. One of \\nthese\\'ll send your kids to college \\nsomeday. \\n(hands it to Benny solemnly)\\nHere � I made this for you. \\n\\nBENNY\\nThanks.\\n(beat)\\nYour dad called again � something about a \\njob.\\n\\nHe hands Jean a slip of paper. He notices the number on Jean\\'s \\npants.\\n\\nBENNY (CONT\\'D)\\nYou got a date already?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(exhaling)\\nWe\\'re getting married. She said she could \\ntell I was a great artist � she could see \\nit in my eyes. She said she wanted to be \\nby my side and have inter-racial babies \\nwith me. \\n\\nBenny grins. He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his \\nindex finger. \\n\\nBENNY\\nG\\'night... See you in court tomorrow.\\n\\nJean turns on the TV. He notices the roach. He picks up the paper \\nBenny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on \\nfire.\\n\\nHe lights the roach with it. \\n\\nHe looks up; on television, we see a BUM being interviewed. Jean \\nturns up the volume. \\n\\nThe bum\\'s on the ground, looking beat up. Jean picks up a pocket \\nrecorder and turns it on:\\n\\nBUM\\nThe guy just hit me and I was on the \\nground!!!! Boom, for real.\\n\\nJean mutes the sound on the TV. He rewinds and proudly plays back \\nthe words \"Boom, for real.\"\\n\\nHe picks up the phone and dials. He turns on the speakerphone. \\n\\nJean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the \\nphone. (Jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following.)\\n\\nVOICE\\nHello?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(deadpan)\\nI-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?\\n\\nVOICE\\nYes. My name is Chris.

Reds, blues, greens.\\n\\nJean opens his notepad and looks down a long list of seemingly \\nrandom words. He comes to the words (in order) \"liquid, hijack,\" \\nand \"Marlboros.\"\\n\\nCHRIS\\nWhat? Wait a minute... talk to me.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(about to sob)\\nLife doesn\\'t... make... sense. This city\\'s \\nk-killing me. I want my liquid hijack \\nMarlboros!\\n\\nCHRIS\\nWhat? Life\\'s beautiful. Depression isn\\'t \\npermanent. Don\\'t you believe that?\\n(pause)\\nWhat is it � did your girlfriend leave \\nyou?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nNo! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.\\n\\nJean spies an electric pencil sharpener and plugs it in.\\n\\nCHRIS\\nYou see? You have someone to live for.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nNo, I don\\'t. I\\'m alone. We all are. \\nEspecially here. The world\\'s unjust. The \\nrespect fools get. The disrespect I get.\\n\\nCHRIS\\nWhat is it you want? Respect? I have \\nrespect for you, just for making this \\ncall. One philosopher said \"Sadness is a \\nsin against the richness of the world.\" \\nThink about it. Feel it.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYou don\\'t even know me. I want real \\nrespect.\\n\\nHe jams a pencil into the electric sharpener and holds the \\nreceiver right next to it, giving the guy an earful: \\nRRRRKKKKKKK!!! \\n\\n\\nANGLE ON\\n\\nCLOSE UP � A speaker. It fills the screen.\\n\\nWe continue to hear:\\n\\nCHRIS (O.S.)\\n(beat)\\nWhat? What do you want?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(breaking loose)\\nFame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the \\nmoon and the cow that jumped over it.\\n\\nCAMERA PULLS BACK FROM SPEAKER TO REVEAL:\\n\\n\\nINT. MUDD CLUB � HALLOWEEN NIGHT\\n\\nJean and Benny are on stage with two other GUYS, members of the \\nband Gray. Everyone but Jean is dressed in some sort of Halloween \\ncostume.\\n\\nWe HEAR the words \"Boom, for real\" blasting from the P.A. system. \\nWhat follows is a continuation, a collage of words from Jean\\'s \\n\"suicide hotline\" call � \\n\\nP.A.\\nOne philosopher said \"Give me my liquid \\nhijack Marlboros. Life\\'s beautiful. You \\nhave someone to live for. What do you \\nwant? RKKKK! That\\'s a beautiful name... \\nFrench?\\n\\nJean sits in a chair onstage with his band members. Benny plays \\nthe organ. The other band members play percussion and guitar.\\n\\nIt works. The crowd loves it. \\n\\nThe song ends abruptly. \\n\\nWe begin to hear James Brown\\'s \"Sex Machine.\"\\n\\nJean looks out into the crowd and notices Gina. She\\'s looking \\nright back at him from the bar. Pleased to see her face, he says \\nto himself � \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nBoom, for real.\\n\\nWe see him walk offstage into the crowd. They meet.\\n\\nBASQUIAT (CONT\\'D)\\nI thought you hated this place?\\n\\nGINA\\nI do.\\n(beat)\\nI just said that. I was never here before. \\nI actually like it.\\n\\nMUSIC segues into PIL\\'s \"Public Image\".\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nLet\\'s get out of here.\\n\\nHe leads her towards the exit. They step out of the club.\\n\\n\\nEXT. MUDD CLUB � NIGHT\\n\\nHIGH, WIDE ANGLE\\n\\nIt\\'s raining heavily. Jean motions for Gina to wait under the \\nentrance. He tries to hail a cab... And another. And another.\\n\\nA parade of them passes, but each time they slow down, they get a \\nglimpse of Jean and drive off.\\n\\nFinally, Gina steps out of the entrance. She raises her hand, and \\na car pulls over instantly.\\n\\n\\nINT. CAB � NIGHT\\n\\nThey scurry into the backseat.\\n\\nThe cab pulls off.\\n\\n\\nEXT.

(Music: REGGAE SONG � Errol Scorcher\\'s \"Cockroach \\nin de Corner.\")\\n\\n\\nEXTREME CLOSEUP\\n\\nA cockroach crawls from Gina\\'s bedroom across the floor and into \\nthe kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a \\ndrawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box.\\n\\nJean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean \\ntears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and \\nbugspray in the other,  he forgets the cockroach. \\n\\nHe\\'s mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can. \\n\\nSomeone POUNDS furiously at the door. \\n\\nIgnoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the \\npiece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a \\nsymbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.\\n\\nLANDLADY\\nMiss Cardinale... Open up for me, please!\\n\\nHe gets up and peeks through the security hole. He sees a middle-\\naged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door. He opens it. \\n\\nLANDLADY (CONT\\'D)\\nOhhh, Dios mio!\\n\\nShe stares at him levelly.\\n\\nLANDLADY (CONT\\'D)\\nI just want the rent.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWhy didn\\'t you say so? Damn! She\\'s asleep!\\n\\nJean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him. He \\nhands it to the landlady. It\\'s a a little shack with a big head \\nnext to it that says \"\\'Here\\' For Rent.\"\\n\\nThe landlady looks at him like he\\'s crazy. She balls up the \\ndrawing and puts it in her pocket.\\n\\nGina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. The landlady\\'s \\ntrapped between them.\\n\\nGINA\\n(to Jean)\\nWhat\\'re you doing?\\n\\nThe landlady wags her finger at Gina.\\n\\nLANDLADY\\nNext Monday.\\n\\nGina and Jean look amused as they watch her leave. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWanna go get some breakfast?\\n\\nGINA\\nA friend of mine offered me a job doing a \\nlittle work installing a show in a \\ngallery. He\\'s an electrician. I was \\nsupposed to be there an hour ago.\\n\\nShe looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor. \\n\\nGINA (CONT\\'D)\\nOhh, that\\'s nice.\\n\\nJean kisses her neck as she looks at the drawing.\\n\\nWe HOLD on the drawing.\\n\\n\\nINT. MARY BOONE GALLERY � DAY\\n\\nWhite dust sprinkles down onto Jean\\'s face from the ceiling. \\nUnable to use his hands, he tries to blow the dust out of his \\neyes... \\n\\nHis boss, GREG, a mild-mannered hippie electrician, works above \\nhim on the ladder.

He tries a couple more � \\nthey each say \"CRAFTSMAN.\" He puts them back. \\n\\nFinally, he finds one with a different handle. It says \"G.S.C. \\n2000.\"\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYou don\\'t have any!!! \\n\\nGREG\\nThat\\'s impossible. I\\'ve got, like, five of \\n\\'em!\\n\\nHe comes down off the ladder.\\n\\nGREG (CONT\\'D)\\nYou\\'re holding one in your hand!!! \\n(beat)\\nYou\\'ve never done this kind of work \\nbefore, have you?\\n(demonstrating)\\nSee, this is a regular screwdriver, and \\nthis is a Phillips head.

I\\'ll tell you later what all the \\ntools are so you\\'ll know. \\n\\nA GROUP of people arrives. \\n\\nAlbert Milo comes into view, tailed closely by Rene Ricard and \\nMARY BOONE � well dressed, petite, intense, 30. Milo, (also about \\n30), wears casual clothes splattered with paint. Mary Boone is \\nengaged in conversation with Milo. Rene chatters away.\\n\\nGreg climbs back up the ladder. He holds a piece of wire down to \\nJean. Jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible.\\n\\nRENE\\nI need to make a call, Mary. You don\\'t \\nmind, do you?\\n\\nMARY BOONE\\nCertainly not. You can use my line.\\n\\nRene picks up the phone.\\n\\nRENE\\nTo Paris.

Hold this, please.\\n(beat � he sees why Jean\\'s \\nso distracted)\\nYou\\'ll get there. But it\\'s good to have \\nsomething to fall back on. That\\'s why I \\nbecame an electrician. It pays the rent. \\nY\\'know, I\\'m an artist, too.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI didn\\'t know. \\n\\nGREG\\nI sculpt. I\\'m really just starting to find \\nmyself. How old are you? Twenty? You\\'re \\njust like I used to be. I\\'m forty-one.

Too bad.\\n\\nMARY BOONE\\nExcuse me, would you please move those \\ntools?\\n\\nJean looks at Milo. Milo looks back at him.\\n\\nJean walks past the tools and continues toward the door. He walks \\nout without turning around.\\n\\nMilo smiles to himself.\\n\\n\\nEXT. BOONE GALLERY � ALBERT MILO OPENING � DUSK\\n\\nThe ART WORLD CROWD fills the gallery. Jean lurks across the \\nstreet, watching through the window.\\n\\nCabs and limousines line the block. A crowd outside blocks the \\nstreet.\\n\\nJean\\'s obviously impressed, jealous and estranged �  he feels \\nentitled to all this. \\n\\nHe crosses the street to get a closer look. \\n\\n\\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW\\n\\nHe sees Albert Milo talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNO \\nBISCHOFBERGER. Andy, of course, is thin, silver-haired, and nearly \\nalbino. Bruno is a Swiss art dealer in his 40\\'s. He exudes money � \\na pillar of security.\\n\\nOn the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a \\ncoterie of young, mostly BLACK AND HISPANIC MALES. Rene looks \\ndrunk, enjoying the moment, holding court.\\n\\nRene crosses to Albert and Andy.\\n\\nPeople pass by. \\n\\nJean starts to walk. \\n\\nAbout half a block away, he sprays on a wall:\\n\\n\"THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE BOW LIKE THIS WITH THE BIG MONEY ALL \\nCRUSHED INTO THESE FEET\"\\n\\nHe looks pleased. He turns and looks up West Broadway beyond the \\nbuildings at the sky:\\n\\n\\nSUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY\\n\\nWe see a surfer emerging from a HUGE WAVE. He looks powerful and \\nexalted.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n\\nEXT. BASKETBALL COURT � DAY\\n\\nANGLE ON: A wall. We see the following graffity:\\n\\n\"JIMMY BEST ON HIS BACK TO THE SUCKERPUNCH OF HIS CHILDHOOD YEARS\"\\n\\nA basketball bounces against a wall.\\n\\nJean and Benny amble onto a basketball court. Jean\\'s changed his \\nhairstyle. Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head. \\n\\nBenny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a \\ncigarette. He doesn\\'t look like he\\'s slept, but he\\'s happy. \\n\\nBenny throws the ball to Jean. It bounces off a puddle and \\nsplashes Jean. \\n\\nBENNY\\nCome on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. \\nConcentrate.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI am... On Gina.\\n(beat)\\nFuck � I didn\\'t think we were actually \\ngonna do this.\\n\\nBENNY\\nConcentrate on the ball.

Famous. To where you can do your \\nstuff all day without thinking about \\nanything else.\\n\\nBENNY\\nUmmm... Four years. Six to get rich.\\n\\nHe shoots. Swish.\\n\\nBENNY (CONT\\'D)\\nFirst, you have to dress right.\\n\\nHe shoots again. Swish.\\n\\nBENNY (CONT\\'D)\\nThen, you have to hang out all the time � \\nwith famous people � the right people, the \\nright chicks, the right parties.\\n\\nHe shoots again. Swish.\\n\\nBENNY (CONT\\'D)\\nAnd you gotta do your work all the time \\nwhen you\\'re not doing that. The same kinda \\nwork, the same style �  over and over \\nagain, so people recognize it and don\\'t \\nget confused. Then, once you\\'re famous, \\nyou have to keep doing it the same way, \\neven after it\\'s boring � unless you want \\npeople to really get mad at you � which \\nthey will anyway.\\n\\nBenny tosses Jean the ball. Jean walks off the court.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nCome on. I hate this. I\\'m no good at it.\\n\\nJean shoots the ball and keeps walking. The ball goes in. He \\ndoesn\\'t notice. Benny runs after it.\\n\\n\\nEXT. HOUSTON ST. � DUSK\\n\\nBenny and Jean walk along. Benny dribbles.\\n\\nBENNY\\nFamous people are usually pretty stupid. \\nYou\\'re too smart.

Then one day they \\ninvented a machine to do it. And he says \\n\"Fuck that, I\\'m a MAN\" and he challenges \\nthe machine to a race to lay down a mile \\nof track. It takes two days.

Just do your shit like \\nyou do it! Your friends like you, you get \\nlaid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff \\neverywhere. It\\'s good.

The \\nsound is turned off and a record player PLAYS Gypsy music loudly.\\n\\nRolled up in a large drop cloth, Gina is asleep on the floor. Next \\nto her, Jean works on all fours, drawing figures, crowns, and \\nhouses.\\n\\nWorking feverishly, he writes \"HEY, HEY, HEY\" in big clusters, \\nthen writes other words: SHARK, IMMORTALITY, JOHN THE REVELATOR, \\nFAME, INK, TEETH, HAWAII SUPERMARKET, POLE STAR, BABOON and TAR.\\n\\nHe has an acoustics manual and Bible open on the floor. He copies \\nthe technical blueprints from the manual. He reads the Bible, \\nfollowing the text with a dirty finger. It seems that he watches \\nTV, draws, listens to the music and reads at the same time. \\n\\nHe mixes Liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings. He \\ndraws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor. Up the \\nwall. Through the fridge. Across the window.\\n\\nHe takes off his paint-covered clothes and changes into Gina\\'s \\nblack slip. He rummages around the room, gathering pieces of his \\nand Gina\\'s clothes.\\n\\nHe spreads the clothes on the floor, and selecting wide brushes \\nwith long bristles, picks up the cans of Liquitex paint.\\n\\nWhen paint spills on the clothes, he spreads it into shapes.\\n\\nGina wakes up.

GINA\\'S APARTMENT � LATER\\n\\nKneeling on the floor, Jean covers the surface of the refrigerator \\ndoor with fast, rushing strokes. He mixes paint in a large \\nsoupbowl and dips his hair in the bowl. Pressing his head to the \\ndoor, he paints with his hair.

Jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties the \\ndope onto the window, and splits it into two lines.

PARTY � NIGHT\\n\\nThe party\\'s winding down � hip-hop kids, Lower East Side types. \\nJean and Benny pass through the room, ignoring the two or three \\nclusters of people � maybe fifteen in all... \\n\\nJean encounters a familiar face: an enormous red-haired dealer � \\nROCKETS (35). They greet each other as friends. \\n\\nRockets leads Jean aside. They stand near a wall where a painting \\nhangs (\"Flats Fixed\"). It bears Jean\\'s three-point crown.\\n\\nROCKETS\\nYou did that, didn\\'t you?\\n\\nJean shrugs.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here \\nfor awhile.\\n\\nJean hands him twenty dollars. Rockets hands him two dime bags. As \\nif thinking better, he hands the bill back to Jean.\\n\\nROCKETS\\nDo one for me and it\\'s free. How\\'s that?\\n\\nJean re-pockets his money. He gestures to Rockets as if to say \\n\"fine � it\\'s a deal.\"\\n\\nHe and Benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the \\nwindow, as before. This time, it\\'s good. They lean back into it, \\nslumping down into the couch.\\n\\nNearby, Rene sits on a couch with THREE STREET KIDS � artists (who \\nwe\\'ve seen at Milo\\'s opening).

People gather around \\nhis paintings. \\n\\nGina arrives. She looks great.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYou look fucking beautiful, beautiful.\\n\\nGINA\\nWell thanks!\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI, a sophisticated, well-groomed woman appears at \\nJean\\'s side. She takes in his paintings.\\n\\nAs Jean, Rene, and Annina talk, Gina is left out.\\n\\nRENE\\nThis is Jean Michel, whose work I told you \\nabout.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\n(to Jean)\\nRene hasn\\'t stopped talking about your \\npaintings. Haven\\'t I seen you in my \\ngallery?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nNo.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\n(to Rene)\\nYou haven\\'t been by lately. \\n\\nRENE\\nI didn\\'t have the subway fare. My Medicare \\nran out.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI \\n(to Jean)\\nHow do you come up with all those words \\nyou put over everything?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI don\\'t know.\\n\\nJean sees Bruno and turns his back to her.\\n\\nBruno looks at the paintings with a smile... He gives a cheerful \\nnod to Annina.\\n\\nBRUNO\\nYou\\'re doing well.\\n\\nHe leaves. Annina\\'s impressed that Jean knows Bruno.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nI\\'d love to see some more of your work... \\nWhere\\'s your studio?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYou name it, I paint there.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nWell, I don\\'t want to get mugged on a \\nBowery street corner. Maybe I could find a \\nplace for you to work. Take my card.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYou want a drink?\\n\\nHe produces a pint bottle in a paper sack.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nNo thanks. \\n(to Rene)\\nBut I\\'d like one of these paintings.\\n\\nShe walks off.\\n\\nGINA\\nWho\\'s that? \\n\\nRENE\\nYou kidding? That\\'s Annina Nosei. Jean\\'s \\nbeen in her gallery a thousand times.\\n(to Jean)\\nYou slut. How do you know Bruno \\nBischofberger? \\n(to Gina)\\nHe\\'s only the biggest art dealer in \\nEurope.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI had lunch with him once.\\n\\n\\nINT. GINA\\'S APARTMENT (BEDROOM) � NIGHT\\n\\nJean and Gina lay in bed. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWhich island of Hawaii do you want our \\nhouse to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?\\n\\nGINA\\n(a little upset)\\nI hadn\\'t thought about it.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(in perfect Hawaiian)\\nOahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee � \\n\\nGINA\\nStaten Island would be ok.\\n\\nBeat. Silence.\\n\\nJean can\\'t sleep. He stares at the ceiling.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nDo you wanna marry me?\\n\\nBeat. \\n\\nNo reply. \\n\\nGina\\'s asleep.\\n\\n\\nINT. GINA\\'S APARTMENT (KITCHEN) � LATER (NIGHT)\\n\\nQuietly, Jean kneels on the floor of the kitchen. He paints on an \\nold window.\\n\\nHe draws figures of three people sitting at a table � obviously a \\nfamily. He crosses out one person and paints a dog under the \\ntable.\\n\\nHe crosses everything out. \\n\\nHe mixes the paint in a large bowl and starts again. \\n\\nAgain, he crosses everything out.\\n\\n\\nINT � GINA\\'S APARTMENT � MORNING\\n\\nJean continues to work. He\\'s wearing pajamas and a bathrobe.\\n\\nGina enters, waking up. \\n\\nShe looks at the painting.\\n\\nGINA\\nKind of a family portrait.\\n\\nJean moves to add something. She stops him.\\n\\nGINA (CONT\\'D)\\nIt looks done.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nThink so?\\n\\nHe pauses.\\n\\nBASQUIAT (CONT\\'D)\\n... babies.\\n\\nGINA\\nYou mean babies with you?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWhat\\'s wrong with me?\\n\\nGINA\\nYou\\'re your own baby.\\n\\nJean paints out the image.\\n\\nThere\\'s a KNOCK at the door.\\n\\nGINA\\nWho is it?\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI (O.S)\\nAnnina Nosei.\\n\\nGINA\\nWho?\\n\\nJean jumps up and locks himself in the bathroom. Gina goes to the \\ndoor, unlocks the chain, and looks out.\\n\\nGINA (CONT\\'D)\\n(through the crack)\\nHello? Oh. Come in.\\n\\nShe opens the door.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nIs Jean Michel here?\\n\\nGINA\\nNo.\\n\\nClosed in the bathroom, Jean smiles while eavesdropping.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nI\\'m here to see some work.\\n\\nAnnina starts noticing all the work around her. Gina hands her a \\nstack of drawings.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI (CONT\\'D)\\nThese are great.\\n\\nGINA\\nAren\\'t they?\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nHow much for these five?\\n\\nGINA\\nYou should talk to him about this.\\n\\nAnnina contains her excitement.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\n(continuing to stare at the \\nwork)\\nUm... Do Rene and Jean have a contract \\ntogether?\\n\\nWe see Jean in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror with \\na bird\\'s nest on his head. \\n\\nANNINA NOSEI (CONT\\'D)\\nI\\'m interested in showing Jean\\'s work.\\n\\nGINA\\nI really think you should talk to him \\nabout this.\\n\\nJean pops out of the bathroom.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWhen?\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nHow about right now?\\n\\nShe opens the door. \\n\\nUnnoticed, Gina starts for the bedroom.\\n\\nGINA\\n(calling back)\\nBe ready in a minute!\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n\\nTHE DOOR SLAMS \\n\\nAs Jean exits with Annina.\\n\\n\\nINT. TAXI � DAY\\n\\nJean waits in a taxi in front of Benny\\'s apartment.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHonk the horn again, will you please?\\n\\nThe DRIVER obliges. The back of the cab is loaded with all his \\nbelongings. Boxes piled with junk. Bags of new painting supplies.\\n\\nBenny emerges from his building and jumps into the cab.\\n\\nBASQUIAT (CONT\\'D)\\n(annoyed)\\nYou\\'re late.\\n(to cabby)\\nOne-fourteen Prince. \\n\\nThe cab pulls out. Jean lights a joint. and smokes it furiously. \\nHe doesn\\'t pass it to Benny.\\n\\nBENNY\\nWhat\\'s the rush, John Henry? \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI ain\\'t John Henry.\\n\\nBENNY\\nGood.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWhat\\'s your fuckin\\' problem, anyway?\\n\\nBenny holds out his hand for the joint.\\n\\nBENNY\\n(inhaling)\\nI don\\'t really have any problems.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nGood. What do you have?\\n\\nBENNY\\nWhat\\'s your fuckin\\' problem? You get a \\ngirlfriend and a little attention and then \\nstart acting all uppity with me.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(mortified)\\n\\'Uppity?\\' Like as in \\'uppity nigger?\\'\\n\\nHe snaps his finger for the joint back.\\n\\nBENNY\\nThat\\'s not how I meant it. \\n(beat)\\nFor all you know, you might just be a \\nflash in the pan! You can never tell.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You\\'re \\njust jealous \\'cause it ain\\'t happening to \\nyou! \\n\\nThe cab stops for a red light. Benny gets out. He doesn\\'t say a \\nword. Jean doesn\\'t look at him. The cab sails off. \\n\\n\\nEXT. ANNINA NOSEI GALLERY � DAY\\n\\nIt stops in front of the gallery. From outside, we see Annina \\nconversing on the phone. She looks up and opens the door for him.\\n\\n\\nINT. STAIRWELL � BLACK.\\n\\nOff screen we HEAR Jean walking down the stairs.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nI\\'ve got to find the switch.\\n\\n\\nINT � BASEMENT, ANNINA\\'S � DAY\\n\\nAnnina flips on a light. \\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nHere it is.\\n\\nJean looks around him. He\\'s in a large, empty cement-floored room \\nlit by fluorescent lights.\\n\\n\\nINT. BASEMENT, ANNINA\\'S � (LATER) � DAY\\n\\nJean bends over, beginning several canvases. He pours paint on \\nthem � kind of like photographs we\\'ve seen of Jackson Pollock. We \\nHEAR Miles Davis\\' \"Flamenco Sketches.\"\\n\\n\\nINT � BASEMENT, ANNINA\\'S � DAY (LATER)\\n\\nGRANDMASTER FLASH\\'S \"WHITE LINES\" fills the room. \\n\\nThe walls are covered with half-finished, unstretched CANVASES. \\nTwo or three more lie on the floor.\\n\\nHe works like a maniac, buzzing back and forth from one painting \\nto another, adding figures, crossing out words, all the while \\nsmoking and eating cookies. The crumbs fall onto the paintings. He \\nwalks on them. \\n\\nEvery so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings. Torn \\npages litter the floor beneath the book. \\n \\nWe hear someone THUMPING down the stairs. \\n\\nIt\\'s Rene. A PUPPY follows him. \\n\\nHe dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryout \\nribs. The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean and walking \\nover the paintings, wagging his tail.\\n\\nHe stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music.\\n\\nJean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke. He cuts a line of \\ncoke on a foil plate. \\n\\nRene starts reading from a poem he\\'s evidently written:\\n\\nRENE\\n3rd night I called him \\'boy\\'\\nHe sed \"don\\'t call me \\'boy\\'\" \"Well\\nThen don\\'t call me \\'Boss\\'\" That\\nWas the end for us and I\\'ve\\nBeen seeing him for 2 1/2 years.\\nIn kangaroo court I want to be\\nAble to say I never kept a \\nSlave. But he tricked me in\\nTo Tying him up and busting his \\nFace. He\\'ll jump up at my Trial\\nYelling \\'He wupped me gud.\\'\\n\\nJean warms the plate \\'til the coke crackles, and then \"chases the \\ndragon,\" sucking the smoke through a straw.\\n\\nHe offers it to Rene, who refuses. He lights and hands Rene the \\njoint. Rene takes a hit. Jean takes it back.\\n\\nJean starts to work again.\\n\\nThe PUPPY runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way, \\nrunning across the paintings. Jean laughs, playing tag. The puppy \\ngets a hold of Jean\\'s sleeve. It unravels about ten feet.\\n\\nWhile Jean\\'s playing, Rene spots a painting with the words \"Famous \\nNegro Athletes.\"\\n\\nRENE\\nOh man! That\\'s one looks famous already.\\n\\nWithout hearing him, Jean walks towards the painting and with a \\nswipe, paints out what Rene is pointing to.\\n\\nRENE (CONT\\'D)\\nYou are a willful boy. How\\'m I s\\'posed to \\nwrite about you if you keep changing \\neverything?\\n\\nThe phone RINGS... Jean ignores it. Rene gets it � \\n\\nRENE (CONT\\'D)\\nUh huhh... Band practice?\\n(to Jean)\\nIt\\'s Benny. He wants to know why you\\'re \\nnot at band practice...?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(quietly)\\nFuck...\\n(to Rene)\\nI forgot about that.\\n\\nHe sets his brush down.\\n\\nRene hold the phone against his leg.\\n\\nRENE\\nFuck band practice... If you\\'re gonna be a \\npainter you\\'re gonna have to break a few \\nhearts � you don\\'t wanna be like Tony \\nBennett..\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nTony Bennett... What do you mean?\\n\\nRENE\\nSinging on stage and painting in your \\nspare time.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI didn\\'t know Tony Bennett painted.\\n\\nRENE\\nMy point exactly.\\n\\nJean picks up the phone... All he hears is a DIAL TONE.\\n\\nRENE (CONT\\'D)\\nSo keep painting.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYes, Boss. \\n(beat)\\nIf you\\'re so smart, why are you here with \\nme in this basement? \\n\\nRENE\\nYou\\'re news. I want the scoop. I write it \\ndown. When I speak, no one believes me. \\nBut when I write it down, people know it\\'s \\ntrue. \\n(beat)\\nThere\\'s never been a black painter in art \\nhistory that\\'s been considered really \\nimportant, you know? \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nSo what?\\n\\nRENE\\nSo shut up and keep painting..\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(touched)\\nWhat time is it?\\n\\nRENE\\n5:11.\\n\\nJean regards a near-finished painting. He writes \"5:11\" on it. He \\ncrosses it out and re-writes it, \"Rene 5:11.\" Rene looks pleased.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nThat one\\'s for you.\\n\\nRENE\\nThanks... I\\'ll take it tonight.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI can\\'t. After the show.\\n\\nJean continues painting. Rene slumps down onto the floor, happy � \\na parasite content to have a host, impressed with Jean\\'s limitless \\nenergy. Rene closes his eyes.\\n\\nBLACK\\n\\n\\nINT. ANNINA\\'S BASEMENT � LATER\\n\\nJean is bent over his work. He looks to see a pair of legs. They \\nbelong to Albert Milo. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHey � it\\'s the big A.M..\\n\\nALBERT MILO\\nRene\\'s been telling me about your work.\\n\\nMilo takes his time looking at the paintings. \\n\\nJean continues to work, never wanting to appear impressed by \\nanyone. He walks on top of the paintings. \\n\\nALBERT MILO (CONT\\'D)\\nIs this finished yet?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI don\\'t know.\\n\\nALBERT MILO\\nWhen\\'s your show?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nNot sure. How was yours?\\n\\nALBERT MILO\\nI haven\\'t decided yet.\\n(beat)\\nRene, you wanna come over to the studio \\ntomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.\\n\\nRENE\\nHow about now?\\n\\nRene shrugs to Jean. He prepares to leave.\\n\\nALBERT MILO\\nSee you at your opening. Thanks.\\n\\nAlbert and Rene begin to ascend the stairs. Jean continues \\npainting. The dog leaves with Rene and Albert.\\n\\nWOMAN\\'S VOICE (O.S.)\\nOhhh, Albert Milo, what a pleasure to meet \\nyou. \\n\\nJean\\'s brush stops.\\n\\nALBERT MILO (O.S.)\\nThis is Rene Ricard. \\n\\nJean paints over the words \"Rene 5:11.\"\\n\\nWe hear FOOTSTEPS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS. The woman continues � \\n\\nWOMAN\\'S VOICE (O.S.)\\nWe\\'re Tom and Cynthia Kruger � nice to \\nhave met you.\\n\\n\\nJEAN\\'S POV\\n\\nWe see Annina\\'s legs coming down the stairs.\\n\\n\\nREVEAL\\n\\nA man wearing a pin-striped suit and gold-rimmed glasses. The \\nwoman is wrapped in a cashmere shawl.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI (O.S)\\nTom and Cynthia Kruger.\\n\\nBASQUIAT (O.S)\\nI know.\\n\\nWe SEE that Jean continues to paint, looking down.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nThis is Jean Michel Basquiat.\\n(beat)\\nYou\\'ve seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere. \\nThat\\'s his. This is the true voice of the \\ngutter.\\n\\nAs she speaks, Jean squirms. He grabs a banana from a fruit bowl. \\nWithout peeling it, he takes a big bite. And another. And another. \\nEveryone looks uncomfortable. Annina starts showing them the \\npaintings.\\n\\nCYNTHIA KRUGER\\nWe\\'ve seen the graffiti. I work on Wall \\nStreet. And I\\'ve heard wonderful things \\nabout the paintings. Everybody\\'s talking \\nabout you.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYeah. \\n\\nHe looks up at them, eating the banana.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nHere\\'s a very good example of his recent \\nwork that\\'s not spoken for yet.\\n(beat)\\nHe\\'s got to work in a basement. He\\'s got \\nso much energy that if he worked in a \\nplace with a window, he\\'d jump right \\nthrough it. Most of these are reserved \\nalready. After this week, this work will \\nnot be available. \\n\\nTOM KRUGER\\n(to his wife)\\n... I don\\'t know.... This one\\'s nice, but \\nI don\\'t know if I could live with it. That \\ngreen is so... institutional.\\n\\nHe (Kruger) looks up to see two KIDS enter � young black artists, \\none of whom we saw with Rene at the loft party.\\n\\nThey walk right into the middle of the room, completely oblivious \\nto the presence of Annina and the Krugers..\\n\\nKID #1\\n(enthusiastically)\\nYo, man, you\\'re a damn lucky nigger \\nselling this shit!\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYou like it?\\n\\nKID #1\\nNot bad. Yeah, I do.\\n\\nThe Krugers hem and haw in front of the painting next to Jean.\\n\\nCYNTHIA KRUGER\\nI\\'m fascinated by his choice of crossing \\nout words that way.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\nYes, well, they are more meaningful in \\ntheir absence, no?\\n\\nKID #1\\n(to Jean, joking)\\nWhat does it mean?\\n\\nJean paints the words \"Rene 5:11\" back into a painting. They \\nignore the kid..\\n\\nCYNTHIA KRUGER\\nI like this one, but that green...\\n\\nSuddenly, we see LEGS coming down the stairs. It\\'s Gina. Everyone \\nlooks at her.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nY\\'want me to make it a nice shit brown?\\n\\nTOM KRUGER\\nBeg pardon?\\n\\nGina hadn\\'t expected to find herself in the middle of this scene.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHi. This is Gina.\\n\\nAnnina nods to her.\\n\\nGina nods to the group. \\n\\nCYNTHIA KRUGER\\nThey\\'re something like Dubuffet\\'s... \\nThat... childlike quality. \\n\\nGina tries to connect with Jean. He\\'s cold. \\n\\nCYNTHIA KRUGER (CONT\\'D)\\n(to her husband and Annina)\\nI can\\'t make up my mind.\\n\\nTOM KRUGER\\nI like this one. If it were just another \\ncolor..\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nGet a fucking decorator. If you buy one, \\nyou\\'ll have to change your whole lives � \\nmaybe even sell your kids!\\n(to Annina)\\nThese paintings aren\\'t even done yet!!! \\n\\nHe sets his brush down. As he leaves � \\n\\nTOM KRUGER (O.S.)\\nI think we\\'ll take the green one.\\n\\n\\nHOLD ON:\\n\\nGina, left standing in the middle of this.\\n\\n\\nINT. MCDONALDS � DAY\\n\\nCLOSE ON McDonald\\'s COUNTERMAN. He smiles.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI\\'ll take three big Macs, two chocolate \\nshakes, two orders of fries, and an apple \\npie. \\n\\nCOUNTERMAN\\nYou want three Big Macs, two chocolate \\nshakes, two orders of fries, and an apple \\npie.\\n\\nA line begins forming behind Jean.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nForget it .I\\'ll take six, no, seven \\nchocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big \\nMac, and two apple pies.\\n\\nCOUNTERMAN\\nYou only want one Big Mac?\\n\\nThe people in line are beginning to get impatient.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nYeah... And make it three apple pies.\\n\\n\\nEXT. SOHO STREET � DAY\\n\\nJean leans on a fire hydrant, eating a Big Mac.\\n\\nA pink scarf blows on the wind right in front of his face. He \\ncatches it. \\n\\nA BOMBSHELL BLONDE arrives with her hand outstretched to retrieve \\nit.\\n\\nBIG PINK\\nHow can I ever thank you?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(with a smile)\\nI\\'d like to squeeze your titties.\\n\\nHe offers her a Big Mac. \\n\\nBIG PINK\\nCome on.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWanna Mac?\\n\\nBIG PINK\\nNo, I\\'d like the scarf.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHave a Mac. \\n\\nBIG PINK\\nI don\\'t eat junk food.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nOh.

What\\'s your name?\\n\\nBIG PINK\\nYou\\'re a fast mover.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nNo name? That\\'s ok. I\\'ll just call you Big \\nPink.\\n\\nA man sleeping on the ground with a beehive of paper bags on his \\nhead and three overcoats sticks out into the sidewalk. \\n\\nJean leaves the McDonald\\'s bag near his head as he walks down the \\nstreet with the girl. \\n\\n\\nINT. GINA\\'S APARTMENT � NIGHT\\n\\nJean enters the apartment.\\n\\nGINA\\nHi. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHi.\\n\\nGINA\\nWhat\\'s that?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nA present I picked up for you.\\n\\nGina holds the scarf up and looks at it.\\n\\nGINA\\nIt\\'s beautiful.

ANNINA NOSEI GALLERY � NIGHT\\n\\nSilence.\\n\\n\\nCLOSE UP PAINTING\\n\\nWe read the words:\\n\\n\"BOOM #2\\nA CAT POURING TACKS ON ITS TONGUE\"\\n\\nSOMEONE (the big red-haired dealer we met earlier) walks in front \\nof us.\\n\\nCAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd in a gallery. It is literally \\nfilled with people. Again � all this takes place in silence.\\n\\nWe begin to HEAR Peggy Lee\\'s \"Is That All There Is?\" It colors the \\nmotion of the crowd. \\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n\\nEXT. PRINCE ST (BET. MERCER AND WOOSTER) � DUSK\\n\\nJean walks down the street. He\\'s got on a new set of clothes and \\nhe listens to a Walkman. We HEAR Miles Davis\\' \"Flamenco Sketches.\"\\n\\n\\nJEAN\\'S POV\\n\\nWe MOVE down Prince St. and take a left on West Broadway. We \\napproach a huge crowd. We get closer and closer until we are \\nimmersed in it. \\n\\nThe crowd realizes Jean\\'s amongst them. People start approaching  \\nhim. Someone removes the headphones. \\n\\nThe DIN of the crowd replaces the music. Amongst the normal crowd \\nchatter, we hear friends\\' calling out:\\n\\nVOICES IN CROWD\\nJean!!! Jean Michel!!!\\n\\n\\nINT. ANNINA NOSEI GALLERY\\n\\nAnnina beckons to him. Beyond her, he sees Albert, Andy, and \\nBruno. He\\'s being escorted or maybe just pushed � it\\'s hard to \\ntell. Each step of the way, he\\'s pounced upon by INDIVIDUALS we\\'ve \\nnever met. The room is wall-to-wall with people. People are swept \\nalong in currents.\\n\\nMAN \\n(wildly enthusiastic)\\nJean, man!!! Let\\'s make a record!\\n\\nWOMAN\\n(slyly, intimately)\\nYou finally did it.\\n\\nMAN #2\\n(pointing to Jean, sneering)\\nHe\\'s so fulla shit.\\n\\nMAN #3 (O.S.)\\nHow much is he getting for these?\\n\\nJean walks up to Andy Warhol.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nAndy, man, thanks for coming.

He slows down and waves.\\n\\nJean sees Gina across the room wearing the scarf.\\n\\nJust beyond her, he sees Big Pink approaching.\\n\\nThere must be ten people between them.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(to Rene)\\nI\\'ll be right back.\\n\\nHe moves towards her. Suddenly, directly in front of him are the \\nKrugers.\\n\\nTOM KRUGER\\nWe love our painting.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWhich painting?\\n\\nTOM KRUGER\\nThe green one.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nOh yeah.\\n\\nCYNTHIA KRUGER\\nWe got a couch to match.\\n\\nTOM KRUGER\\nShe\\'s only kidding!\\n\\nLooking past the Krugers, Jean looks for Gina. He sees her. His \\npath is blocked.\\n\\nHe presses forward, looking for Gina, getting caught in the crowd.\\n\\nJean strains to keep an eye on Gina and Big Pink..\\n\\nBenny arrives at Jean\\'s side holding a bottle of Jack Daniels and \\na shot glass.\\n\\nBENNY\\nWillie Mays. A Toast.\\n\\nJean brushes past him. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nNot now, ok?\\n\\nBenny is left standing next to Andy holding the bottle.\\n\\nJean manages to advance a few more feet through the crowd, then \\nruns smack into Rockets, his drug dealer.\\n\\nROCKETS\\nJean Michel, my man. Nice party. Should we \\nstep into my office?\\n\\nNearby, Benny sees this meeting and walks off, disgusted, thinking \\nthis is why Jean gave him the brush off.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nThat\\'s alright. I\\'m cool now.\\n\\nJean looks off and sees Big Pink fingering the scarf, saying \\nsomething to Gina. \\n\\nGina slaps her in the face.\\n\\nJean tries to get around the dealer.\\n\\nGina turns to leave. She catches Jean\\'s eye. \\n\\nShe walks out.\\n\\nROCKETS\\nA gift! I was just trying to give you a \\ngift!\\n\\nThe dealer palms something to Jean.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI gotta go.\\n\\nJean steps away from Rockets, but is trapped in the crowd. Rockets \\nlooks after him with disappointment.\\n\\nRene arrives with, Andy, Bruno, and a PHOTOGRAPHER.\\n\\nRENE\\n(edging his way in)\\nThis guy wants a picture.\\n\\nThey shrug and crowd in � Jean, Andy, and Rene. The photographer \\ngets them to squeeze closer and closer. \\n\\nPHOTOGRAPHER\\nOf the painters, please.\\n\\nThere\\'s not enough room. Rene accidentally gets pushed out of \\nframe.\\n\\nRene fumes. Albert Milo arrives with his parents (JACK AND ESTHER \\nMILO). They are a nice Jewish couple in their 70\\'s.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHe said \\'of the painters!\\' Hey � Albert! \\nGet in the picture!\\n\\nAlbert crowds in. The photographer SNAPS a picture and the FLASH \\nblinds everyone momentarily. \\n\\nALBERT MILO\\nHey, Jean, I\\'d like you to meet my \\nwife....and my parents. Mom, Dad, this is \\nJean Michel Basquiat.\\n\\nJean pulls out a joint and lights it as if it were a cigarette.

I\\'d \\nlike to buy it for myself. \\n\\nJean spots the very word on the painting (\"Rene 5:11\") and freezes \\nfor a second. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI wasn\\'t gonna sell this one.\\n\\nHe looks around the room for Rene, but doesn\\'t see him. Bruno \\nremains smiling, waiting for an answer.\\n\\nBRUNO\\nYou shouldn\\'t have put it in the show. \\nThis is the one I absolutely have to have. \\nI really love it. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nSure, ok..\\n\\nJean wants out. He feels compromised. \\n\\nBASQUIAT (CONT\\'D)\\nDo you think I could borrow your \\nlimousine? I\\'ll get it back to you in an \\nhour.\\n\\nBRUNO\\nIt\\'s OK. Just have him bring you to dinner \\nat Mr. Chow\\'s later. We\\'ll be there.\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nBye, Jean. \\n\\nJean makes his way through the crowd, as we see images of the \\ncrowd and fragments of paintings. As he nears the door, he feels \\nhis arm pulled.\\n \\nRENE\\n(hissing)\\nYou fucking little whore! You sold my \\npainting! I\\'m gonna tell you something, \\nbrother � when you\\'re climbing up the \\nladder of success, don\\'t kick out the \\nrungs! Believe that shit.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nI\\'ll make you another one. \\n\\nRENE\\nForget it. \\n\\nHe pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nRene �\\n\\nRene shushes him... He hisses loudly, like a cat.\\n\\nRENE\\nSHHHHHH. Later.\\n(speaking to himself)\\n\"What is it about art, anyway......\"\\n\\nJean pauses. He turns around and surveys the room once more. \\n\\nA blink. \\n\\nSilence. \\n\\nWe see the crowd in SLOW MOTION.\\n\\nEveryone\\'s eyes are shut.\\n\\nRENE (O.S.; CONT\\'D)\\n... that we give it so much importance? \\nArtists are respected by the poor because \\nwhat they do is an honest way to get out \\nof the slum using one\\'s sheer self as the \\nmedium. The money earned is proof pure and \\nsimple of the value of that individual... \\nThe Artist. \\n\\n\\nINT. / EXT. GALLERY � NIGHT\\n\\nThe CAMERA rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows Jean \\nas he makes his way toward the street.\\n\\nWe begin to DISSOLVE into a MONTAGE of stills of ARTISTS:\\n\\nRENE (O.S.CONT\\'D)\\nThe picture a mother\\'s son does in jail \\nhangs on her wall as proof that beauty is \\npossible even in the most wretched. And \\nthis is a much different idea than the \\nfancier notion that art is a scam and a \\nrip-off. But you could never explain to \\nsomeone who uses God\\'s gift to enslave \\nthat you have used God\\'s gift to be free.\"\\n\\n\\nEXT. STREET � NIGHT\\n\\nJean enters a waiting limo.

I\\'d be glad to.\\n\\nThe limo pulls over. \\n\\nDRIVER\\nHere?\\n\\nQuickly, Jean gets out of the limo. He leaves the door open. \\n\\nThe DRIVER watches as Jean talks to two DRUG DEALERS. \\n\\nJean jumps back into the limo.\\n\\nThe driver pulls away. In the rearview mirror, he sees Jean \\nseparate a bag from a bundle of ten. He rips it open and snorts \\ndirectly from it. \\n\\nHe lays his head back and takes a deep breath. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\n(calm, relieved)\\nWhat\\'s your name, man?\\n\\nDRIVER\\nThey call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nNice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?\\n\\n\\nINT. MR. CHOW\\'S RESTAURANT � NIGHT\\n\\nAn elegant Chinese restaurant on the Upper East Side. The dining \\nroom is split level with a mezzanine reserved for celebrities and \\nspecial friends of the owner. \\n\\nAt the podium, the MAITRE\\'D approaches.\\n\\nMAITRE\\'D\\nGood evening.\\n\\nFrom behind the Maitre\\'d on the mezzanine we see Bruno waving to \\nJean. \\n\\nIn the dining room on the lower level sit Annina and Rene. Nearby, \\nat another, smaller table, are seated DAVID MCDERMOTT and PETER \\nMCGOUGH, two artists dressed in Victorian attire.\\n\\nAnnina beckons him. \\n\\nRene looks away from him and talks to a WAITER.

Dinner\\'s already \\nserved.\\n\\nAt the large table, everyone watches as Milo makes a portrait of \\nFrancesco in a beautiful leatherbound book. It belongs to Mr. \\nChow, who is nearby at the bar.\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nHi, Jean.\\n\\nHe motions to Mr. Chow to set a chair for Jean between Mary Boone \\nand himself. \\n\\nBRUNO\\nJean, everyone loved your show.\\n\\nAs Jean is seated, Andy and Jack Milo resume conversation � \\n\\nJACK MILO\\nNixon lives in Saddle River, New York.\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nSaddle River\\'s in New Jersey.\\n\\nJACK MILO\\nSaddle River, New York!\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nIt\\'s in New Jersey.\\n\\nJACK MILO\\nNew York.\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nI think it\\'s in New Jersey.\\n\\nJACK MILO\\nIt\\'s in New York.\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nOh, I didn\\'t know that.\\n\\nCLOSE UP: Jean smiles at Andy\\'s diplomacy.\\n\\nAlbert finishes drawing his portrait: it\\'s Francesco with his arm \\naround a headless torso. \\n\\nALBERT MILO\\n(to Francesco)\\nYou finish it.\\n\\nHe pushes the book across the table.\\n\\nFrancesco begins to draw. \\n\\nMARY BOONE\\n(to Jean)\\nI hear your show was sold out already. \\nThere\\'s a very important collector who\\'s \\ninterested in some of your works.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nBring him over sometime. I have some other \\nstuff to show him.\\n\\nAnnina watches from the other table as Jean talks to Mary.\\n\\nFrancesco finishes his drawing.\\n\\nAlbert takes the book and passes it to Jean.\\n\\nALBERT MILO (CONT\\'D)\\nGo on, take it..\\n\\nJean takes it. Mr. Chow watches his book change hands.\\n\\nJean takes a bowl of moo-shoo pork in front of him and dumps it \\nonto the book. Then he uses a piece of pork to draw a head.\\n\\nSuddenly, there\\'s a shrill, familiar voice.\\n\\nRENE\\nI\\'d like a glass of your best champagne, \\nplease?\\n(reading)\\nThis is an enormously important season in \\nNew York, and to make a false step could \\nhave severe repercussions for years. We \\nare no longer collecting art, we\\'re buying \\nindividuals.\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nOh shut up, Rene.\\n\\nRENE\\nEverything\\'s over your head, Andy.

You can\\'t buy advertising \\nlike this. This is the most glamorous \\ndinner you\\'ll have here this fall. How \\nabout some of that imitation crab? \\n\\nMR. CHOW\\nI\\'m not paying for the drawing with crab. \\nIt\\'s a present to my friends.

Thanks, Jean.\\n\\nHe rips the page from the book.\\n\\nRENE (CONT\\'D)\\nHe owes me one.\\n\\nEveryone\\'s face drops. Mr. Chow grabs his book. He motions to a \\ncouple WAITERS � \\n\\nMR. CHOW\\nYou\\'re too much, Rene. Get this guy out of \\nhere.\\n\\nRENE\\nI haven\\'t eaten yet!!!\\n\\nThe waiters grab Rene\\'s arms. \\n\\nRENE (CONT\\'D)\\nHands off me, you faggots! I\\'m going.

CHOW\\n(exhausted)\\nSome other time.\\n\\nSpontaneously, David McDermott climbs onto the tabletop downstairs \\nand sings \"Paris Je T\\'aime.\" \\n\\nAs he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto, he glides over \\nglasses and plates, executing a leap to another table in mid-song. \\n\\nThe restaurant staff and OTHER DINNER GUESTS watch, agape. \\n\\n\\nCLOSE UP � DAVID\\'S SHOES.\\n\\nAs David dances, Annina walks over to the table, greeting people \\nand saying goodnight.\\n\\nANNINA NOSEI\\n(to Jean)\\nIt\\'s great that people are interested, but \\nif anyone\\'s going to buy anything, I\\'ll \\nhandle it for you.

As they take their seats, Jean \\nnotices the suppressed giggles coming from the executives\\' table. \\nThey try to ignore it. George disappears.\\n\\nJean seems self-conscious about the sores on his face. \\n\\nGINA\\nSo are you really friends with Andy? He \\nseems like such a weirdo. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nHe\\'s not. He\\'s out of town and he calls me \\nevery day. What\\'s weird about him?\\n\\nGINA\\nDon\\'t you think he\\'s using you?\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWhy does everybody say that?

In Europe, people are saying \\nyou\\'re gonna die from drugs. They think \\nthey can cash in on your death. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nWhen I was poor, everybody doubted I could \\nmake it.

His \\nart\\'s dead.\\' I don\\'t take drugs, anyway. \\nI\\'m healthy now.\\n\\nJean obliterates Andy\\'s logo.\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nIf you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m. \\nYou call at four in the morning. You never \\nshow up anywhere on time � if you show up. \\nYou\\'re painting out everything I do! \\n\\nAndy paints back in part of the horse.\\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nThat\\'s better.\\n\\nJean adds some letters on top of Andy\\'s logo.\\n\\nANDY WARHOL\\nI can\\'t even see what\\'s good anymore.\\n\\nJean Michel obliterates the rest of the logo with some white.\\n\\nAndy steps back and squints as he examines Jean\\'s work. \\n\\nANDY WARHOL (CONT\\'D)\\nYeah, I see what you mean about the white. \\nIt\\'s better.\\n\\nJean quits painting. \\n\\nBASQUIAT\\nAfter the show we should take a nice long \\nvacation.

The studio is crowded with PEOPLE. (Many of them we \\nrecognize from earlier scenes in Mudd Club, Jean\\'s opening, etc). \\nOn the wall there is a portrait of Jean by Andy. The background is \\na piss painting.\\n\\nInside, Jean kneels on the floor in the corner of the loft with a \\nbunch of people around him � girls, mostly.

His face is slightly swollen. His \\ncomplexion is discolored.\\n\\nShenge covers a triptych with wide brush strokes of yellow paint. \\nHe circles a large, primitive figure of a black man drawn with \\nmagic marker in the center.

If you show too much respect \\nfor people with money, they don\\'t have \\nrespect for you.\\n\\nMARIA, a raven-haired, sharp-featured beauty in a Chanel suit \\njacket, blue jeans, and pearls walks into the room.

I just can\\'t even care anymore. \\nCompare this to a mountain or a tree. \\nWho\\'re y\\'all trying to kid? That\\'s what I \\nthink.

No. I mean, \\ncompared to the rain forest or something? \\nThese are just narcissistic jokes.\\n\\nMARIA\\n(to Jean)\\nWho are you selling these through now?\\n\\nJean gets to his feet.
